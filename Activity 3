Activity File: Oh Henry, What Did You Do?


You continue in your role as a security analyst at Candy Corp, investigating the employees potentially selling secret recipes to Sugar Corp.


Your manager at Candy Corp has identified two possible insiders who may be working with Sugar Corp: Henry and Ruth.


Your manager pulled some files from Henry and Ruth's computers without their knowledge.


Some of the files contain gibberish, but some may have useful data.


Your manager has asked you to preview the files to see if they have readable text data that can be analyzed later.



Instructions
Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from the /03-student/day1/oh_henry/ folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:

  cd /03-student/day1/oh_henry/
  /03-student/day1/oh_henry$ ls

There are two folders inside the /03-student/day1/oh_henry/ folder: One for files captured from Henry and one for files captured from Ruth.

  cd /03-student/day1/oh_henry/henry$ ls
  cd /03-student/day1/oh_henry/henry/files$ ls

Use the preview commands to determine which of the files contain readable text data.

  /03-student/day1/oh_henry/henry/files$
  less b7.txt
  more bb.txt
  head -5 do.txt
  less sp.txt
  more wp.txt

  /03-student/day1/oh_henry/ruth/files$ 
  less hy.txt
  more l8.txt
  head -3 ud.txt
  less sd.txt
  more ta.txt

Remove the files that contain non-readable text data.

  /03-student/day1/oh_henry/henry/files$ rm b7.txt bb.txt dj.txt
  /03-student/day1/oh_henry/ruth/files$ rm sd.txt ta.txt


Bonus
The files each have a timestamp at the bottom.

  tail do.txt
  tail sp.txt
  tail wp.txt

  tail hy.txt
  tail l8.txt
  tail ud.txt

Use the mv command to rename each file by adding the date found on the bottom of the file.
 
  /03-student/day1/oh_henry/henry/files$
  mv do.txt do.txt_10_13_2019
  mv sp.txt sp.txt_10_14_2019
  mv wp.txt wp.txt_10_15_2019

  /03-student/day1/oh_henry/ruth/files$
  mv hy.txt hy.txt_10_14_2019
  mv l8.txt l8.txt_10_13_2019
  mv ud.txt ud.txt_10_15_2019

  

For example, File1 has a date of October 11, 2019. Rename it to file1-10_11_2019.
