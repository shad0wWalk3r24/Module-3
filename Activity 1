Activity File: Take Five and Practice the Command Line
You are playing the role of a security analyst at Wonka Corp.

Wonka Corp believes one of their employees might be selling secret recipes to Slugworth Corp.

You have been tasked with creating evidence files for email, logs, and web access.

These files are currently empty, but will be used later to organize your investigation notes on the rogue employee.

Instructions
Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from within the /03-student/day1/take_5/ folder in your Ubuntu VM:

  cd /03-student/day1/take_5/

Create a folder called Internal_Investigation_Employee_A.

 mkdir Internal_Investigation_Employee_A

Navigate into the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder.

  cd /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A

From within the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder, print the working directory to confirm you are in the correct place.

  pwd /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A

Create three files inside the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder:

email_evidence
log_evidence
web_evidence

  touch email_evidence log_evidence web_evidence

Delete the file called web_evidence as you realized Wonka has no web logs captured.

 rm web_evidence

Display (list) all the files created.

  /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A$ ls

Clear the terminal window.

  /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A$ clear
