Activity File: Find your Milky Way


You will continue in your role as security analyst at Candy Corp, investigating the employee potentially selling secret recipes to Sugar Corp.


Your manager at Candy Corp needs you to create an additional directory, as they believe there is a second employee working with Sugar Corp.


You must also copy and move several of the evidence files after creating this new directory.



Instructions
Using only the command line, continue to complete the following tasks in the /03-student/day1/take_5 folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:

  cd /03-student/day1/take_5

Create an additional folder called Internal_Investigation_Employee_B.

  mkdir Internal_Investigation_Employee_B
  /03-student/day1/take_5% ls  

Using absolute paths, move the file email_evidence from Internal_Investigation_Employee_A to Internal_Investigation_Employee_B as you have been told there will not be email evidence for the first employee.

  mv /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A/email_evidence /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_B/

Using absolute paths, copy the file log_evidence from Internal_Investigation_Employee_A to Internal_Investigation_Employee_B, as you have been told there will likely be log evidence from both employees.

  cp /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A/log_evidence /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_B/

Check your directories to confirm the files are all in the correct locations

  /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A$ ls
  /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_B$ ls
